## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Igor Tavares ðŸ˜ƒ 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Frontend Developer** who loves build meaningful, scalable and well documented applications. With a strong focus on **customer-centric products**, over the past few years, I have worked extensively within the Whirlpool ecosystem, building and improving applications that enhance the customer care experience.

I have a deep passion for data-driven development, UX research, and leveraging user feedback to create intuitive and impactful digital experiences. My work combines technical excellence with a user-focused mindset, ensuring that every product I contribute to solves real problems efficiently and elegantly.

I thrive in environments where I can explore **complex challenges**, **integrate multiple systems**, and continuously optimize for both **performance** and user **satisfaction**. Always curious and eager to learn, I am constantly exploring new technologies and methods to make software more reliable, enjoyable, and accessible.
